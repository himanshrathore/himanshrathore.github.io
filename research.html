Vast observations have enabled the utilization of the Clouds as an Astrophysical lab. I am using this lab to advance our understanding of galaxy dynamics, interstellar medium & dark matter physics, using a combination of observational datasets, numerical simulations & analytical theory.

				Despite a wealth of observations, interpreting the SMC’s structure & kinematics has been a challenge. The SMC’s gas exhibits a substantial velocity gradient, yet the stars show minimal rotation. The SMC has an on-sky stellar extent of a few kpc, yet its line of sight depth is > 10 kpc, and the stellar and gas centers are separated by > 1 kpc. The SMC is clearly in a very high state of disequilibrium. Using hydrodynamic simulations, in <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06075">Rathore+2025(c)</a>, we showed that the SMC’s disequilibrium can be attributed to a recent (&lt; 200 Million years ago) direct collision between the SMC and LMC. Tidal forces and ram pressure exerted by the LMC transforms the SMC from a rotationally supported to a dispersion dominated galaxy.

In <a href = "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad93ae">Rathore+2025(a)</a>, we used Gaia DR3 data to measure the geometry and strength of the LMC's bar with the stellar density field. To perform this measurement, we developed a novel solution to tackle crowding induced incompleteness in Gaia datasets. Surprisingly, we found that the LMC hosts a strong bar, similar to other barred galaxies in the local universe. <br><br>

				Why does the LMC's bar show such strange properties despite being consistent with bar - galaxy co-evolution ?

				Using hydrodynamic simulations of the LMC - SMC - Milky Way interaction history, in <a href = "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ade0ae">Rathore+2025(b)</a> we showed that the LMC bar's strange properties are explainable with a recent (150 - 200 Million years ago) direct collision between the LMC & SMC. This collision also significantly slows down the LMC's bar, potentially explaining the low observed pattern speed values. Further, the LMC bar's tilt is a direct probe of the SMC's dark matter profile, and requires the SMC to be a dark matter dominated galaxy.

				S0 galaxies possess well defined disks, but lack spiral arms and are generally expected to be quenched. Hence, the existence of star-forming S0s poses a significant challenge to galaxy evolution theories. In <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/513/1/389/6561635">Rathore+2022</a>, we performed a detailed study of star-forming S0s with resolved spectroscopic observations from the SDSS-MaNGA survey combined with deep optical imaging. Surprisingly, star-forming S0 galaxies in the local universe possess centrally dominated star-formation, which is different from disk dominated star-formation in typical spiral galaxies. Moreover, the star-forming S0s were most likely quenched S0s in the past whose star-formation has been rejuvenated, possibly through mergers with smaller galaxies.

				<p style="font-size:20px" align="justify"> The Hubble tension is a raging debate in cosmology about the current expansion rate of the universe, as quantified by the Hubble constant. Early universe probes like the Cosmic Microwave Background and late universe probes like the Cepheid-Supernova distance ladder give different values of the Hubble constant. One possible explaination for the Hubble tension could be physics beyond the framework of general relativity, like a time varying gravitational constant (G). In <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2024/06/056/">Ruchika, Rathore et al. 2024</a>, we proposed a transition in the value of G at late times, and evaluated its affect on the distance ladder. Through a careful statistical analysis, we found that a 4% larger value of the G at lookback times > 70 Million years is preferred by local universe data. Such a G transition is within existing observational constraints and can resolve the Hubble tension.
