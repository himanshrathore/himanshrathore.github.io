				<p style="font-size:20px"> The Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC & SMC) are the two nearest satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. These galaxies have likely been interacting with each other over the last few billion years. This system is associated with very interesting and peculiar observables like the gas stream, the bridge, LMC's off-centered bar, LMC's one-armed spiral to name a few. In this project, I am trying to perform numerical simulations of the Magellanic Clouds in order to explain various observations associated with this system. With a wealth of observational data, combined with accurate numerical models, the Magellanic clouds are an excellent laboratory for testing galaxy evolution theories.

				<p style="font-size:20px"> S0 galaxies possess well defined stellar disks, but lack spiral arms and are generally  quenched. However, there exists a statistically significant number of S0 galaxies in the local universe that show active star-formation. The prevailing theory for the origin of S0s relies on strong in-situ as well as environmental quenching. As such, the existence of star-forming S0s poses a significant challenge towards understanding the nature of this class of galaxies. The origin of star-formation and the star-formation properties of such galaxies have been a subject of debate since the last two decades. In this work, we did a detailed study of star-forming S0s with resolved spectroscopic observations from the SDSS-MaNGA survey combined with deep optical imaging. We peformed the first spatially resolved analysis of the star-formation properties of these galaxies and also attempted to settle the debate on the origin of star-formation in these galaxies.

				<p style="font-size:20px"> The Hubble tension is a raging debate in cosmology about the current expansion rate of the universe, as quantified by the Hubble constant. Early universe probes like the Cosmic Microwave Background and late universe probes like the Cepheid-Supernova distance ladder give different values of the Hubble constant, the difference being highly significant statistically. One possible explaination for the Hubble tension could be physics beyond the framework of general relativity, like a time varying gravitational constant (G). In this work, we proposed a transition in the value of G at late times, and evaluated its affect on the physics of Cepheid variables and Supernova explosions, and thereby the distance ladder. We performed a careful statistical analysis to identify whether such a G transition can the solve the Hubble tension.
